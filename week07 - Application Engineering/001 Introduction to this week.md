# 001 Introduction to this week

* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmQuvmpt_ZQ)

Three topics

* durability of writes (how we know data is persistant on disc)
* replication (MongoDB's approach to fault tolerance and availability)
* sharding (allows to distribute a collection across multiple servers to gain greater throughput)

Since this is a course for developers, focus will be on how to use those features, not on how to actually configure and set them up.
